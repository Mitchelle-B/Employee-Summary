## About The Page ## 

 The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This tasks passes all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application creates a HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
